Dear Professor,
we would like to include some information and instructions:

1.Code
- If you want to run the code, please run the file 'main.py'
it will open a command line and tell what should be done.
- Additionaly more information about the code is added
in the Report.

2. Tableau
- all screenshoots of visualization are added in the Report. 
However, we recommend you to visit the website for better
experience with visualizations: https://public.tableau.com/profile/grzechowiak#!/

3. Data sets
- in general we merge 5 different files together and they are downloaded
in code, everytime the code is ran. However, the folder 'files' include 3
files, because one of the file is too big to be included. It can be see
accessing the link specified in the file called data_collector.py
(data not included are: Real-Time Traffic Incident Reports and 
Mixed Beverage Gross Reciepts.

4. Final data sets
- the final output of the function (merged data) is in folder 'Final Data'


We hope you enjoy reading the project! :)
